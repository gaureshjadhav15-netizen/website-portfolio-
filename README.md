🧭 Interactive Navigation Menu
This project demonstrates how to create an interactive navigation menu using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The navigation bar remains fixed at the top of the page, changes style when scrolling, and also provides hover effects on menu items for a smooth and engaging user experience.

🚀 Features
✅ Fixed navigation bar — always visible at the top of the page.
🎨 Color change on scroll — background and text colors update dynamically when the user scrolls.
🖱️ Hover effects — each menu item highlights with a color change on hover.
📱 Responsive design — works smoothly on both desktop and mobile screens.
⚡ Lightweight and fast — built using only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

🧩 Technologies Used
HTML5 — structure of the navigation bar.
CSS3 — styling and hover animations.
JavaScript (ES6) — interactivity and scroll-based color change.

💻 How It Works
The navigation bar is created using semantic <nav> and <ul> tags in HTML.
CSS is used to make it fixed, style the background, and add hover animations.
JavaScript detects when the page is scrolled and toggles a CSS class that changes the navigation bar’s color and text style.

⏱️ Stopwatch Web Application

This project is a simple and interactive Stopwatch Web Application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It allows users to start, pause, reset, and record lap times easily in a clean and responsive interface.

🚀 Features
▶️ Start the stopwatch to begin timing.
⏸️ Pause to temporarily stop counting.
🔁 Reset to clear the timer and start over.
🏁 Lap Functionality — record multiple lap times.
💡 Accurate time tracking using JavaScript’s timing functions.
📱 Responsive design — works on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

🧩 Technologies Used
HTML5 → Structures the stopwatch elements (buttons, display, etc.)
CSS3 → Adds styling, layout, and animations for an appealing UI
JavaScript (ES6) → Implements logic for timing, lap recording, and interactivity

🧠 How It Works
The stopwatch display is built using HTML <div> elements.
CSS is used to design and align the buttons and time display.
JavaScript uses the setInterval() function to update the time every 10 milliseconds.
The app provides buttons for:
Start: Begins counting time
Pause: Stops the timer without resetting
Reset: Sets the time back to 00:00:00
Lap: Records and displays the current time as a lap

🌤️ Weather Web Application

This project is a Weather Web Application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It allows users to fetch real-time weather data based on their current location or a user-specified location.
The app displays important weather information such as temperature, humidity, weather conditions, and more, in a clean and user-friendly interface.

🚀 Features
📍 Location-Based Weather: Automatically detects the user's current location to fetch weather data.
🏙️ Search by City: Users can input a city or location to view weather information.
🌡️ Current Weather Display: Shows temperature, weather conditions, humidity, wind speed, and other details.
🎨 Responsive Design: Works smoothly on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
⚡ Real-Time Data: Fetches live weather data from a public weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).

🧩 Technologies Used
HTML5 → Structure of the web page and input fields.
CSS3 → Styling and layout for an attractive UI.
JavaScript (ES6) → Fetches API data, updates the DOM, and handles user input.
Weather API → OpenWeatherMap API (or any other free API) to retrieve real-time weather information.

🧠 How It Works
User Location Detection:
Uses the browser’s navigator.geolocation API to get the current coordinates.
Sends coordinates to the weather API to fetch data.
Search by City:
Users can enter a city name in the search input.
The app makes a request to the weather API with the entered city and displays the results.
Data Display:
Temperature, weather condition, humidity, wind speed, and an appropriate weather icon are displayed dynamically.
Error handling if the location is invalid or the API request fails.
